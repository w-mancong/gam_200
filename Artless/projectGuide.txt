Things showcase in this demo:
Animation
- Sprite animation can be changed by using 'A' and 'D' keys
Audio
- Audio is able to be played through different channels
Physics
- Player object is able to be moved around with forces
Particle System
- Show casing of particle system, able to change the properties of it on the editor
Fonts
- Two different fonts are rendered onto the screen
Event System
- OnCollideEnter, OnCollideStay, OnCollideExit, OnPointerEnter, OnPointerClick, OnPointerStay, OnPointerExit
Button
- A button is shown onto the screen, 
Parent children relationship (Scene Graph)
- Adding children to a parent, children will follow wherever parent goes
AI
- Currently there is a room that is constructed with grids and cells that will be used by AIs and units for
 pathfinding that the pathfinding system is fully implemented.
- Currently there is an entity that makes use of the room that will act as a sample for our pathfinding.
Editor
-More details on editorGuide.txt

Character Controller
-2D platforming controls W, A, S, D to move up, left, down, right by addforce
-Spacbar to jump

Things to do in demo
-There is a yellow coin on the right, touching it will make the coin disappear and print out "Coin Collected" in logger
-Bottom on bottom, can left click on it and it will print "Click" onto logger.
-There is a an bunch of green boxes, these are the objects that will be used for our pathfinding system in the near future.
-A entity is making use of the cells, to imitate what we will achieve.

Build Settings
10.1. Debug 
When building the project in debug mode, there will be no optimization of the code at all. 
Warning Level will be set to 4. This build will be the slowest among the two other build. 
This build is to be used for the development of the engine and will be used to debug the codes. 

10.2. Development 
Like debug mode, Warning Level will also be set to 4. A low-level optimization of the code 
will be applied to this build. This build will be used for alpha testing where optimization 
is wanted but we still want to be able to catch some errors. 

10.3. Distribution 
This build is mainly for the distribution of our game engine. Codes are compiled in the most
optimized way possible, very prone to breaking if there are underlying bugs in the build. Hence 
this is only used at the end when distributing to our “customers”.
